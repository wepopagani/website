Hi, I'm Marco! I'm 21 years old and an economics student with a passion for the world of computer science. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform the world.

I firmly believe that innovation is the key to a better future, and I'm eager to actively contribute to this process. My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and seek creative solutions to problems.

Besides computer science, I'm interested in design, art, and culture. I enjoy traveling, discovering new places, and meeting people from all over the world.

I'm a determined, curious person who is always ready to learn. I love challenges and I strive to achieve my goals.

I'm convinced that 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that can change the way we design, create, and produce objects. I'm excited to be part of CreaLab and to contribute to making this technology accessible to everyone.

If you have an idea you want to turn into reality, don't hesitate to contact me!
